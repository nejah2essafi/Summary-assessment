//Create three input elements of type checkbox
  //Create two buttons "create" & "remove"
  //Create 7 classes in CSS each with the appropriete color (black, purple, green, orange, red, yellow, blue)
  //Using jQuery run a function that gets called using the button's id (#create)
  //The function takes see if the checkboxes are checked or not (true or false), use $("#id").prop('checked')
  //If all 3 checkboxes are checked add an list item with the word black in it and add the "black" class to it
  //If 2 of the checkboxes are checked add (purple = blue + red), (green = blue + yellow), (orange = red + yellow)
  //If 1 of the checkboxes is checked add (yellow, blue or red) as li and the class to it
  
  //Using jQuery call a function from the button's id (#delete)
  //The function removes all the elements from the unordered list based on the checkboxes as the previous function
  //Use jQuery as much as you can in selecting elements and other tasks -->
